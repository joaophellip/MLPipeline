# MLPipeline

Cozo Machine Learning Pipeline.

This repository contains routines to assess convergence, test assumptions, and grid-search a prediction model with best out-of-sample error performance. 

The scripts run in R and they're not ready to be integrated to the Cozo platform. Current version isn't fully automated to generate model either - it requires researcher to validate hypothesis and convergence based on scripts outputs. 

Work in progress: automation of convergence and assumption testing criteria.
